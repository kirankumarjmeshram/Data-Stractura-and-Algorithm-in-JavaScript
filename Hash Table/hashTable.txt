a hash-table is used to implement

associative arrays or mappings of key

value pairs hash tables are a common way

to implement the map data structure or

objects they are widely used because of

how efficient they are the average time

for each lookup is not tied to the

number of elements stored in the table

in fact the average time complexity of

hash tables and big notation is o of 1

for a search insert and delete that's

very fast the way a hash table works is

that it takes a key input and then runs

it through a hash function a hash

function basically just Maps strings to

numbers and usually the numbers just

correspond to indexes in an array so for

example here are the strings we pass

through the hash function and then we

get the numbers over here a hash

function needs to be consistent so when

you run a key through the hash function

it always gives the same number and it

should map different words to different

numbers if two words get hashed to the

same number this is called a collision

you can see in this example John Smith

gets hashed to two Lisa Smith gets

hashed to what was either one Sam dofor

and then Sandra D also gets hashed to

two so this is a collision because both

these names once they run through the

hash function get turned into the same

number or the same index for the array

one way to handle collisions is just to

store both key value pairs at that index

then upon lookup of either you would

have to iterate through the bucket of

items to find the key you are looking

for this could take a little extra time

because of the iteration so here's

another example where it's showing that

the names are going through the hash

function and then it's showing basically

the information that's being stored in

the bucket so this would be the array

index and then in that array index or

the bucket we would store the phone

number so this would be like a phone

book the numerical value from the hash

function is then you

and the index to store that information

then if you try to access the same key

again the hashing function will process

the key and return the same numerical

result which will then be used to look

up the associate value which just means

that once you store all these things in

the array once you want to get the

number again you would just pass in the

key John Smith into the hash function it

would give you the exact same array

index too and then you would get the

information returned to you which is the

phone number

now you will probably never have to

implement hash tables yourself because

most languages including Java Script

already have them built-in in JavaScript

hash tables are usually used to

implement objects however it can be

helpful to see how they are implemented

just to gain a better understanding so

I'm going to show you the code for a

hash table so you can see how they work

first of all we have our hash function

where we're gonna pass in the string

that we want to hash and then the Max

Max is the number of buckets that we're

using in our hash table to store values

we're gonna start with hash being 0 and

we are going to for each character in

the string string that length for as

long as the string is we are going to

add the care code of each character each

string character has a numerical value

associated with it so basically we're

just adding up the character codes for

each character in the string and putting

into the hash now instead of returning

the hash we're gonna return hash modulus

maths that just means we are going to

divide by the number of buckets and then

return the remainder so if we had 5

buckets if we're divided by 5 the

remainder is either there going to be 0

1 2 3 or 4 and then that would be the

index that we're going to place the item

into the array now this is a very simple

hash function just for an example but

they can get much more complicated now

let's go into the hash table function so

in the hash table function we're gonna

have our storage array which is where

we're gonna store all that data we're

putting

to it and the storage limit now this is

the number of buckets in the array at

first I'm just gonna show you with just

four different buckets but normally

actually this number would be much

higher and this is just a utility

function just for this example so I can

easily print all the items in this

storage array I can easily log them so

here's where the real methods come in

for the hash table if we want to add

some information so first you're gonna

pass in a key and a value we're gonna

figure out the index of the array by

running it through the hash function so

we create this hash function where we're

gonna pass in the key and the storage

limit the number of buckets that we're

gonna have in our hash table and that's

going to return an index that we went

over before if there's nothing in that

index in the storage array if it's

undefined we're just going to set the

index to be this key value pair array

else if it's not undefined that means

there's already something in that bucket

so first we're gonna set insert it to

false and then we're gonna go through

each index to see if the key already

exists if the key already exists we're

gonna set the new value here and set

insert the true if the key does not

exist then insert is still gonna be

equal to false so we're going to push in

the new item that's where we'll get

multiple entries into one bucket so the

next thing is if we're going to remove

an item from the hash table so if we're

gonna remove you're just passing the key

of what you want to remove and now we're

gonna look up the index by passing it

into the hash function if the index that

length equals one that means there's

only going to be one item in that bucket

and the item in that bucket equals the

key that you passed in then you can just

delete that index you can just sleep

that item

but if it does not equal one that means

there's probably a few different items

at that index and we want to only delete

the item associated with that key so

we're going to go through each item in

that bucket or in the

next and if the key equals the key we

passed in then we can delete that item

the zero index is the key the one index

is the value so let's go how we would

look up an item again we're gonna set

the index using our hash function with

the key that we passed in and the

storage limit if the index there is

undefined we just return undefined it's

not the item is not in the hash table

else we're going to go through each

element in that bucket if the element

equals the key then we can return that

element so let's look at a few examples

first I'm going to show you an example

of the hash function here if we run that

for me three and every time I run that

you'll see in the console three three

three every time I put Bo it's gonna put

three but if I put a different name here

and I run that you can see on the

console it's gonna be five and now every

time I run that's gonna be five so with

this hash function it's going to always

be a number between zero and nine

because we're passing in ten as the

number of buckets so now let's actually

see the hash table so here we're gonna

create a new hash table called hte for a

hash table we're gonna add Bo who's a

person and find out it was a dog retsu

the dinosaur tux who's a penguin then

we're gonna look up tux and then we're

just gonna print the entire thing so

let's see what happens in the console so

we saw that tux is a penguin now let me

bring this over a little bit it's going

to show our entire half state well not

normally you're never gonna print out

the hash table like I did to the console

but I just did that just for learning

purposes if you remember up here we have

the storage limit set up for so we only

have four buckets the reason why I had

it set up for is so we'll see what it

looks like when there's a collision when

there's two things in one bucket just by

coincidence the first buck is undefined

that means none of these words hashed to

zero and then if we look at the second

bucket that's right here there's

actually two key value pairs

in the second bucket so both bow and tux

both gave one when it went through the

hash function and then you can see in

this bucket right here

we just have one item and then this

bucket right here we just have one item

so when we pass in Rex to the hash

function we got three returned but if we

go up here and we change the number of

buckets to something like 14 now I'm

gonna try running that again if you look

right here now there's a lot more

undefined because most of the buckets

are now empty but this bucket only has

one item that bug is one item and then

the last two bucks have one item and

there are no collisions now each bucket

only has one item now this has just been

a pretty simple example of a hash table

implementation but it's enough to give

you a basic idea of the hash table
